    <h1> Education </h1>
    
    <h2>Medieinstitutet - Blockchain Developer (current)</h2>
        <p>Studying Node.js, React and solidity and learning about the business and legal implications of blockchain technology. </p>
    
      <h2>Uppsala University - Bachelor of Arts </h2>
        <p>I majored in german, wrote my thesis on german advertisement and spent one semester abroad in Freiburg. My minors were practical philosophy and aesthetics. In addition I enrolled in the bachelor program in business and economics but after just one semester there I got a job offer I couldn’t refuse...
        </p>

      <h2>KTH</h2>
        <p>Before moving to Uppsala I spent some time at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and took classes in programming, communication, numerical methods and environmental physics and chemistry to name a few. The hours spent in MathLab and Python proved useful in coding this website.
        </p>
        
      <h2>GIH</h2>
        <p>After working in online marketing for about two years I decided to try out the Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences where studied sport didactics, health and human biology. I did it to get a broader perspective on personal and public health and I try to incorporate the things that I learned into my daily life.

    <h1> ART </h1>
        
        <h2> This particular Work </h2>
        <p>This is the first major piece of art that I bought. An aluminum piece by Ilja Karilampi. 
        </p>

        <h2> The Biological Museum</h2>
        <p>
          I've always been interested in art and when I worked at the Biological Museum in Stockholm during my studies we hosted art shows such as <a href="http://belenius.com/exhibitions/biotop-2014/" target="_blank" >Biotop</a> by Galleri Niklas Belenius, photo shoots with famous photographers (such as Nan Goldin) and events advertising agencies (such as Studio Total).

    <h1> Sport </h1>
      <p>
        I grew up playing hockey and when i moved to Uppsala I switched over to the ice based bandy, playing in the second division. I've also competed in karate (Kata, no fighting), played golf (Hcp 6,9) and worked as a climbing coach for children at Klättercentret. Last summer I hiked Kebnekaise and finished the Stockholm sprint Triathlon.

    <h1> Work </h1>

    <h2> Saint-Gobain Distribution Sweden - internship october 2023 - present </h2>
    <p>
        I’m doing my internship at the E-commerce department as a backend
        developer. The tech stack includes, but is not limited to, the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Node.js </li>
        <li>TypeScript</li>
      </ul>
      <p>AWS services such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>DynamoDB</li>
        <li>Lambda</li>
        <li>SQS</li>
        <li>CloudWatch</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        From the start, I have tackled real-life tickets, with a significant
        focus on managing product data, including its transformation and
        integration with Product Information Management (PIM) and Enterprise
        Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Additionally, I have worked on services
        related to the shopping cart and order placements. The work environment
        is highly Agile with lots of pair programming and great teamwork, which
        has significantly enhanced my learning experience.
      </p>
    
    <h2> Manifest </h2>
    
     <p>Manifest is a global agency with offices in London, Manchester, New York, Stockholm and Melbourne. It’s hard to sum up all the things I’ve done during my time at manifest but just to give you an idea, my tasks have ranged from developing B2B strategies on LinkedIn for nordic defense companies and hotels to coming up with creative ideas for Petter Stordalens Instagram and Gianni Russo's new clothing brand.
     </p>
    
     <h2> Arla – New & Social Media Officer (covering for a maternity leave) </h2>
    
     <p>I believe there is no need of further introduction of this company. I worked with a range of brands, local as well as global, b2c and b2b, organic and paid. I also played a critical role in the development of SOME content advising both the production team as well as the brand managers on what works and why. 
     </p>
    
    <h2> Belong Agency – Social Media Manager </h2>
    
     <p>Belong is a creative full service agency with offices in Sweden, Denmark and Norway working with clients like Proctor & Gamble, Bosch and Mars. As social media manager I am involed with implementing global social media strategies to the Swedish market for some clients and in creating Nordic social media strategies for others. I am especially proud of some organic posts I created for Bosch and Dremel that I would very much like to share with you!
     <br><br>
     
     I had to come up with something for <a href="https://bit.ly/34cRHcn" target="_blank" >world poetry day</a> and was given only the background picture to work with.
     <br><br>
     
     SOME content doesn't always have to be expensive to produce. The most important thing is that it is relevant to the audience.
     Take this <a href="https://bit.ly/34f5X4p" target="_blank" >bottle cap challenge</a> post for instance that I made on the fly.
     <br><br>
     
     Whenever possilbe I also like to sneak in a bit of <a href="https://bit.ly/3jgz23U" target="_blank" >göteborgshumor</a> 
     
     </p>
    
    
    <h2> KSMG – Business Operations Manager </h2>
        <p>Kindegren Singh Media Group is a full service agency for Social Media Marketing helping several of the world's largest companies such as Volvo, Spotify, SEB, AMF, Coca-Cola, Axfood and Worldclass to maximize their results in social media with focus on employer branding and recruitment marketing. Working closely with the CEO and the Business Area Manager as Business Operations Manager we set out to develop a brand new business area in marketing and E-commerce on Facebook and Instagram. I was involved in creating and working with: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Internal processes</li>
          <li>Strategies for operations</li>
          <li>Client social media strategies</li>
          <li>Campaign optimization and budgets</li>
          <li>And reporting</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        This resulted in a brand new company and I came up with the name for it... Gravel!
        </p>

        <h2> Gravel - Business Operations Manager </h2>
        <p> 
        With only the name set the first object was to define and build our own brand. I then, as before, handled all operative aspects and worked with:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>Internal processes</li>
          <li>Strategies for operations</li>
          <li>Client strategies</li>
          <li>Project management</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="http://gravel.se/pon-cat-2/" target="_blank" ><i>Case - Pon Equipment</i></a> <br>The goal was to drive awareness for their new hybrids and eco friendly technologies. We came up with a 2D web-based game where you drove around a hybrid wheel loader and scored extra points for collecting eco friendly items on the way. Weekly winners collected Cat branded merchandise and we got a huge response!
        
    
       
      <h2> Ingager – Perfomance Marketer </h2>
        <p>The Facebook specialist Ingager is working with brands like BMW, Daniel Wellington, PWC, Mini and Schibstedt combining data-based decisions with engaging content to increase sales and brand awareness.
        <br><br> 
        I was their first German speaking employee and played a big role in their expansion to the German market. Initial tasks included language localization, finding a German country manager and looking for office space. I then took over all incoming German clients working closely our country manager, head of sales, graphic designers and developers to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Develop concepts and plan out campaigns</li>
          <li>Manage ad budgets</li>
          <li>Optimize campaigns</li>
          <li>Report directly to the clients</li>
        </ul>

      <h1> Music </h1>
      <h2>Adolf Fredik's Music School</h2>
      <p>
         I attended AF and got to sing choral music at the biggest venues in
         Stockholm. There were extra auditions for the Royal Opera and I
         managed to make two. Puccini's Tosca and La bohème.
      </p>
      <h2>Electronic Music</h2>
      <p>
         I produced music and DJ:ed under the name of Phillip Mox at some of
         the biggest venues in Stockholm and also did appearances in Berlin
         and Uppsala. Click <a href="https://soundcloud.com/phillip-mox" target="_blank">here</a> to hear some of my songs.
